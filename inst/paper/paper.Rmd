## Introduction

Analysis software is a key part of modern reliability engineering. Software
helps engineers to model complex systems and analyze large datasets efficiently, 
abilities that are increasingly important as systems and data become more advanced. 
Today, most reliability studies rely on specialized software, including both commercial 
programs and open-source tools. These tools provide many functions, such as statistical 
modeling and data visualization.

As reliability engineering continues to grow, the need for analysis software that 
is both powerful and easy for many people to use also increases. Accessible software 
makes it easier for others to reuse and reproduce an analysis. Reproducibility allows 
independent verification, while reusability helps others build on previous work. 
These goals are especially important in reliability engineering, where accurate and 
dependable analyses directly affect system performance and safety.

Open-source software (OSS) supports these goals by making software open and freely 
available. OSS not only increases transparency but also fosters collaboration and 
innovation within the community [1]. Community contributions help identify and fix 
bugs, improve features, and adapt the software to new use cases. This collaborative 
approach leads to higher-quality software that better meets the needs of its users.

Recent efforts to improve the quality of OSS have focused on adapting the FAIR principles 
[2] to software development. Originally created for managing scientific data, the 
FAIR principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability 
have also been shown to improve the quality and impact of analysis software [3].

Despite these advances, reliability engineering is still not widely supported. Many 
reliability tools are proprietary, which limits access for a broader audience. The 
open-source options that do exist are tied to specific programming languages. While 
popular packages are available in R [4] and Python [5], they require programming 
skills that may be a barrier for some users.

This article introduces ReliaShiny, a web-based application that makes reliability 
analysis easier to use. Built on the Shiny framework [6], ReliaShiny offers an interactive 
interface for Life Data Analysis (LDA) and Reliability Growth Analysis (RGA), two 
key tasks in reliability work. The application follows the FAIR principles, aiming 
to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable for the reliability community.

The following sections explain how ReliaShiny was developed, how it is designed and 
structured, and how to use it for reliability analysis. The article ends with a discussion 
of future work and possible improvements.

## Development

This project started as a proof of concept for performing Life Data Analysis (LDA) in 
a web application. The initial goal was to build an easy-to-use interface for popular 
reliability software packages, making these tools more accessible to a wider audience. 
Although still under active development, the application has reached a stable stage 
and is now available for public use. Over time, new features, such as support for 
Reliability Growth Analysis (RGA), have been added based on user feedback. Moving 
forward, development will focus on adding more functions to support a broader range 
of reliability analyses.

The development process was guided by the FAIR principles for research software. 
These principles shaped important decisions throughout the project, from selecting 
the core features to designing the user interface. By following FAIR, the goal was 
to build software that is not only useful but also easy to find, access, integrate, 
and reuse. This approach helps ensure that the application can effectively meet the 
needs of its user community.

The following sections describe how the FAIR principles were applied during development.

* **Findable**: The ReliaShiny software and metadata are available in public repositories, 
  including GitHub (https://github.com) and the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)           (https://cran.r-project.org). These repositories provide documentation, installation 
  instructions, user guides, and examples. Because the package is indexed on CRAN, 
  users can easily find it when searching for reliability analysis tools. The software 
  is also assigned a unique identifier through its CRAN package name, making the 
  software easy to reference in other work.
  
* **Accessible**: ReliaShiny can be easily obtained using standard methods. Users 
  can install the package directly from CRAN using built-in package tools or get 
  the latest development version from GitHub. The software is open, free, and available 
  without restrictions.
  
* **Interoperable**: The software is interoperable with other tools and workflows 
  commonly used in reliability engineering. ReliaShiny is built in the R programming 
  language, which is popular in data science and engineering. The application can 
  be run on a local computer or on a web server, making it easy to integrate with 
  existing data analysis pipelines. It also supports standard data formats for input 
  and output, allowing seamless data exchange with other software.
  
* **Reusable**: The software is both usuable and reusable by others. The source code 
  is available under a CC-BY-4.0 license, which provides open access but no warranty.
  Comprehensive documentation and examples are provided to facilitate understanding and 
  use of the application. Additionally, references to the underlying models and methods 
  are included in the documentation to ensure proper attribution and citation.
  
While the application adheres to the FAIR principles, some limitations remain. 
First, ReliaShiny is not a complete reliability analysis tool. The application currently 
focuses on LDA and RGA, with plans to add more functionality in the future. Second, 
the web version has limits on data size to maintain performance, which may restrict 
some analyses. Users who need to work with larger datasets can use the local version 
without these limits. Finally, although the application is designed to be user-friendly, 
some basic knowledge of reliability concepts is still needed to use it effectively.
To help those getting started in the field, the ReliaLearnR [7], [8] project was created
as a companion resource. ReliaLearnR provides learning modules and educational resources
to help users understand fundamental reliability concepts and methods.

## Design

ReliaShiny is built with the Shiny framework, which is used to create web applications 
in R. Shiny apps are reactive, meaning their outputs update automatically whenever 
inputs change. This reactivity allows for highly interactive workflows, making it 
easy to explore and visualize data quickly. Users can try different inputs and instantly 
see the results without having to refresh or rerun any code. 

A Shiny application has two main parts: the user interface (UI) and the server logic. 
The UI controls how the app looks and how users interact with it, while the server 
logic handles the calculations and processes the data.

Shiny offers several layout templates and also allows building interfaces with custom 
HTML. ReliaShiny uses the shinydashboard [9] package, a Shiny extension made for 
dashboard-style applications. The user interface is organized into multiple menus 
for key tasks like data input, model fitting, and visualization. The app also uses 
the shinyWidgets [10] package to provide better input controls and make the app easier 
to use.

On the server side, ReliaShiny is built on key R packages for reliability analysis 
and visualization. The WeibullR [11] package provides tools to fit and analyze Weibull 
distributions, which are widely used in life data analysis. The ReliaGrowR [12], [13] 
package helps with reliability growth modeling, allowing users to track and improve 
system reliability over time. The ReliaPlotR [14] package lets users create interactive 
reliability plots, making it easier to understand results through dynamic visualizations.

## Usage

ReliaShiny is available in two primary ways: as a web application hosted online 
and as a local application that can be run on a user's machine. The web-hosted version
is accessible via a web browser, providing a convenient option for users who prefer 
not to install software locally. The local version can be run by first installing 
the software package from CRAN or GitHub, and then launching the application using 
a simple command. This option is ideal for users who require offline access or wish 
to customize the application for their specific needs. 

### Web-based Example

To illustrate the functionality of the web-based application, the following example 
provides an overview of performing LDA using a sample dataset. 

First, access the web application online at https://paulgovan.github.io/ReliaShiny/ 
or launch the local version using the following commands. This code assumes that 
the ReliaShiny package is already installed.

```{r}
library(ReliaShiny)
ReliaShiny()
```

After launching the application, the Landing page first appears. The Landing page 
provides options to:

* Access the Project Site and Documentation
* View the Source Code Repository
* Download an example dataset
* Navigate to other menus within the application

The figure below shows the default Landing page. 

![](https://github.com/paulgovan/ReliaShiny/blob/master/inst/images/Landing.png?raw=true){width=100%}

For this example, navigate to the Life Data menu and click on the Data sub-menu.
The Data tab provides options for uploading and arranging data for analysis. The 
application also includes several example datasets that can be loaded directly, and 
this example use the sample "Time-to-Failure" dataset.

At this stage, the application should resemble the figure below. This figure shows 
the data upload and arrangement options, along with a preview of the dataset. The 
menu has several options for customizing the data arrangement, such as specifying 
censoring types and grouping variables, but this example uses the default settings.

Next, navigate to the Model sub-menu to fit a reliability model to the data. The Model
tab provides options for selecting the distribution type, estimation method, and
other model settings. For this example, the Weibull distribution is selected with
the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method. Feel free to experiment with different 
configurations to tailor the model to specific needs. The figure below shows the 
Model tab with the selected settings.

![](https://github.com/paulgovan/ReliaShiny/blob/master/inst/images/ProbPlot.png?raw=true){width=100%}

Next to the model setting options is the Weibull probability plot and a summary of 
the fitted model. The plot is interactive, allowing users to zoom in and hover over 
points to view additional information. The summary provides key statistics about 
the fitted model, including parameter estimates and goodness-of-fit metrics. 

Finally, visit the Contour Plot tab to visualize the joint confidence region for the
Weibull parameters. The contour plot displays the confidence intervals for the shape
and scale parameters, providing insights into the uncertainty associated with the 
estimates. The figure below shows the contour plot generated by the application. 
This plot is also interactive, allowing users to zoom in and hover over points.

### Programmatic Example

For users who prefer programmatic access, ReliaShiny comes prepackaged with the 
ReliaPlotR package. This package provides functions for generating interactive reliability 
plots similar to those found in the web application. This option is ideal for users 
who wish to integrate reliability plotting into their existing workflows or who prefer 
coding over using a graphical interface.

To illustrate programmatic analysis, the following example demonstrates basic 
RGA using the ReliaPlotR package. 

First, start by loading `ReliaGrowR` and `ReliaPlotR` in the R environment.
```{r warning=FALSE}
library(ReliaGrowR)
library(ReliaPlotR)
```

Next set up some example cumulative time and failure data. This data represents
the times at which failures occurred during testing and the corresponding number 
of failures at each time point.
```{r}
times <- c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500)
failures <- c(1, 2, 1, 3, 2)
```

Then run the RGA using the rga function from the ReliaGrowR package. This function 
fits a reliability growth model to the provided data and returns the results. 

Finally, use the plotly_rga function from the ReliaPlotR package to create an
interactive plot of the RGA results. This plot allows users to visualize the reliability 
growth over time and explore the data interactively.
```{r}
result <- rga(times, failures)
plotly_rga(result)
```

The figure above shows the resulting interactive plot generated by the previous code.
Similar to the plots in the web application, this plot is interactive in a web 
environment, allowing users to zoom in and hover over points to view additional 
information about the analysis.

ReliaPlotR also includes functions for generating other types of reliability plots. 
For example, to see how the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) changes over time, 
try the following code:
```{r}
plotly_duane(result)
```

The previous figure shows the interactive plot generated by the previous code. Similar
to the other examples, this plot is customizable, allowing users to adjust the appearance
and layout as needed.

## Future Work

While the project is now in a stable state, there are still several opportunities 
for future development and improvement. Beyond expanding existing features, such 
as adding more options for model fitting and visualization, there are plans to support 
other types of reliability analysis. A natural next step is adding tools for repairable 
systems, since RGA methods share many similarities with this type of analysis. This 
would involve implementing the right models and creating tools for working with repairable 
system data. Another promising direction is support for Accelerated Life Testing (ALT). 
ALT has requirements similar to LDA but uses different data structures and methods. 
WeibullR.ALT [15], an extension of WeibullR, already provides ALT-specific functions, 
and bringing these capabilities into ReliaShiny would be a logical next step. These 
additions would broaden the application’s usefulness and make it a more complete 
resource for reliability engineers.

As an open-source project, community contributions are encouraged. Development so 
far has been guided largely by user feedback and requests, and this collaborative 
approach will continue. Future work will reflect the changing needs and interests 
of the user community, with possible improvements such as new modeling options, 
better visualization tools, and more documentation and examples. Ongoing development 
may also be influenced by emerging trends and advances in the field.
